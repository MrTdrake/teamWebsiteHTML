# teamWebsiteHTML
GIMM 300 project 1

Team Website: HTML
Importance:
Many of the web apps and websites developed in industry and the private sector are group efforts (and almost all tech companies operate in scrum or agile groups), accordingly it is vital you learn to communicate and work effectively with other developers, digital artists/designers, testers, and project managers.  I will ask you to try each of these roles even if it is not your preferred role in a group project so that you have enough empathy, understanding, and experience in this role to work effectively with others that take that role on for group work.  
 
There are four roles, one for each group member (if your group has more or less than four contact me and we’ll work something out where a member or a role doubles up).  These are project lead, digital artist/web designer, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer.  Please note that for the first three team projects you will all be doing a certain amount of coding to get familiar with and practice with html, css, and javascript foundations.  For all projects, you must indicate who has what role and stick with those roles for this project, then switch for the next website project so that everyone gets a chance in every role.  This should be well documented and easy for me to look over and understand who was doing what and what they contributed in the website design doc that you will submit with your group game, and you should indicate who is switching to what role for the next group project in a clear way.
 
Explanation: 
 
This is a short list of just some of the tags many web developers use frequently, but for a complete and categorized list you can go here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp.
You should explore, practice, and learn the common and uncommon tags listed here.  To help with this, here’s a quick project to get comfortable and familiar with html elements:
Using visual code, create eight new files, called them index.html, nested.html, attributes.html, and tags.html, and one new page for each of your group members names with the .html extension (i.e. bob.html, susan.html, etc).  
From the index.html file, create links to all the other files.  To do this, you can use a nested tag like this: 
<ul>
<li><a href=index.html>home</a></li>
<li><a href=nested.html>nested examples</a></li>
<li><a href=attributes.html>attribute examples</a></li>
<li><a href=tags.html>tag examples</a></li>
<li><a href=bob.html>Bob’s page</a></li>
<li><a href=susan.html>Susan’s page</a></li>
</ul>
This method of making an unordered list of links in index.html at the top of the page is, with some styling, the basic structure of a website nav bar.  As a bonus, try and get the list elements to look like a nav bar that appears on every page.
In the tags.html file, have each group member use 10 different tags from this list with about two different tag types from each category to create a wide variety of different html elements.  Don’t forget to start this file and the others with basic webpage html elements in the appropriate places like this:  
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
            
In the nested.html file, each group member should create 4 different 5 level deep nested tags (not counting the <html> and <body> as nested elements).  So for example a very simple 2 level nested tag using an unordered list would look like: <ul><li>first item</li></ul>
and three level nested tag with an ordered list might look like:
<ol><li><a href=index.html>home</a></li></ol>
In the attributes file, get familiar with attributes by first having each group member select the elements from nested.html and tags.html that they’re proud of, and then adding at least 10 attributes each throughout the page.  You can learn about attributes here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp 
Finally, link to these files using an <a> tag in index.html in a tasteful way - you may want to use the <img> tag as well and get some .png or .jpg files representing your links. 


Most of your grade will be determined by carefully documenting your group’s cooperative dynamics and the responsibility for this falls primarily on the project lead although other group members should help, so bear this in mind as you set up and manage the trello board and the group WDD (web design document) where you will write up your groups collective contributions following this template: GIMM 300 Website Design Doc Template

When you finish your team website, post your experience as a team and a link to the website on the group discussion board thread in blackboard group discussion called team websites and apps and have each individual member make constructive and helpful comments on three different other team websites.  As the template indicates, include documentation of each member’s comments (12 total comments/screenshots, all on different websites) in your WDD.  It is important we all learn as a community and I want you to have the opportunity to show your work, help others, and be helped by others in the class, so it is vital for the class that you do this last step.
Rubrix/Assessment:
Here’s what I’ll look at to determine your grade on this group project (500pts max)
 
A detailed account up of the contributions of all group members in the WDD according to the template here: GIMM 300 Website Design Doc Template (150pts possible)
Screenshots showing completion of every group member’s freecodecamp exercises (25 pts possible) 
Screenshots of all group members comments on other teams’ website posts to blackboard discussion, with each member commenting on different websites.  In other words, 12 total other group websites should be commented on if possible - 3 per group member.  Group also must post a publicly accessible link to their own website for others to comment on.  (25  pts possible)
A write up of who will be the next project lead, digital artist/designer, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer in the group (everyone must fill each role once)  (25 pts possible)
Screenshots and links for group coordination in github and trello (25 pts possible)
Project requirements outlined in 1-6 of the Explanation Section above are achieved with excellence (200 pts)
